# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services
{: #about}

[{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services®](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services){: external} is designed to build trust and enable a transparent public cloud ecosystem with the features for security, compliance, and resiliency that financial institutions require. Financial institutions can confidently host their mission-critical applications in the cloud and transact quickly and efficiently. With a large partner ecosystem of independent software vendors (ISVs), Software as a Service (SaaS), and fintech partners, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services offers a new generation of cloud for the enterprise. Financial institutions can now deploy on public cloud to enable innovation and deliver new outstanding customer experiences, while managing stringent industry regulations for sensitive data and complex workloads.

## {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}}
{: #ibm-cloud-framework-for-financial-services}

{{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} is designed to help address the needs of financial services institutions with regulatory compliance, security, and resiliency during the initial deployment phase and with ongoing operations. The framework also helps to simplify the ability of financial institutions to transact with ecosystem partners who deliver software or SaaS applications, and who meet the requirements of the framework.

The {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} consists of:

* A comprehensive [set of control requirements](#framework-control-requirements) designed to help address the security requirements and regulatory compliance obligations of financial institutions and cloud best practices. The cloud best practices include a shared responsibility model across financial institutions, application providers, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
* Detailed [control-by-control guidance](#framework-guidance) for implementation and supporting evidence to help address the security and regulatory requirements of the financial industry.
* [Reference architectures](#framework-reference-architectures) designed to facilitate compliance with the control requirements. In addition, resources are provided to [deploy infrastructure as code](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-deploy-infrastructure-as-code) in order to automate deployment and configuration of the reference architectures.
* Tools and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} services, such as [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-monitoring-compliance), to enable parties to efficiently and effectively monitor compliance, remediate issues, and generate evidence of compliance.
* Ongoing governance of the framework documentation that considers new and changing regulations, as well as bank and public cloud requirements.

### Control requirements
{: #framework-control-requirements}

The technology-agnostic control requirements defined in the framework were built by the industry for the industry. The framework contains 565 control requirements that span 7 focus areas and 21 control families. The control requirements were initially based on [NIST 800-53 Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_1/home){: external} and have been enhanced based on feedback from leading industry partners.

See [{{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} - Control Requirements](/docs/framework-financial-services-controls) for a complete description of all control requirements. Or, if you prefer, there is a [downloadable spreadsheet](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/framework-financial-services/IBM_Cloud_Framework_for_Financial_Services-Control_Requirements_v2.0.0.xlsx){: external} available as well.

The control requirements mentioned in this documentation by default is IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services v2.0. For v1.1, refer to [{{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} - Control Requirements v1.1](/docs/framework-financial-services-controls-fsv1-1). [Downloadable spreadsheet for v1.1](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/framework-financial-services/IBM_Cloud_Framework_for_Financial_Services_-_Control_Requirements_v1.1.0.xlsx){: external} is available as well.

### Framework guidance and reference architectures
{: #framework-guidance}



#### Interpreting the framework guidance
{: #interpreting-guidance}

We refer to the entity that uses (consumes) an application as the _consumer_ and the entity that develops or deploys (provides) an application as the _application provider_. The consumer and application provider might be the same when the organization providing the application also consumes it (for example, a financial institution deploys an application for internal use by others in their company). Or, they might be different if a third-party ecosystem partner is providing an application for a financial institution to use.
{: note}

You should use the information in the framework if you are an application provider (whether from a financial institution or ecosystem partner) who wishes to meet the requirements or leverage the best practices of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services. However, the content has a different purpose depending on whether you represent an application provider from an ecosystem partner or an application provider within a financial institution.

Ecosystem partner
:   The reference architectures and guidance form a set of _requirements_ if you want to pursue a designation of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated](#becoming-fs-validated) from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. The Financial Services Validated designation signifies that you have successfully evidenced compliance to the control requirements of the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} and may improve your ability to market to financial institutions. Even though these should be considered requirements, there is a process for requesting the approval of deviations when certain aspects of the guidance may not be feasible or make sense for a given application.

Financial institution
:   The reference architectures and guidance form a set of  _recommendations_. As a financial institution, you know your controls better than {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does. So, you have latitude in terms of following the guidance depending on what your internal controls dictate and the level of risk you are willing to take. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not formally validate the applications of financial institutions.

In addition, the framework is intended to cover the two types of applications that you might deliver as an application provider:

* Software as a service (SaaS) – You develop and operate the application that is deployed on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using one of the reference architectures for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services.
* Software – You develop the application software, and another organization deploys and operates the application on their infrastructure in their own {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.




#### Control implementation overview templates
{: #control-implementation-overview-templates}

The templates that are referenced in this section are available under NDA only. Work with your {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} account representative to get access.
{: tip}



The framework's control implementation overview (CIO) templates provide detailed implementation and evidence guidance for all of the framework's control requirements. Each of the templates provides guidance specific to the underlying {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} technology used in one of the [reference architectures](#framework-reference-architectures). They are referred to as "templates" because they allow you to assess how well your solution meets each of the control requirements. A completed CIO template is a requirement for any ecosystem partner seeking to be Financial Services Validated.

#### Reference architectures and deployment guidance
{: #framework-reference-architectures}

[Reference architectures](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-reference-architecture-overview) have been defined which can be used as a basis for meeting the security and regulatory requirements defined by the controls. The reference architectures each center on specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} technologies, including:

{{site.data.content.reference-architectures-list-full-names}}

In addition, prescriptive [deployment and configuration guidance](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-deployment-setup-environment) is provided for the components in each of these reference architectures. The guidance is intended as an easier to consume supplement to the CIO templates that is more appropriate for architects and developers trying to build and implement applications for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services.

## Becoming {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated
{: #becoming-fs-validated}

IBM designates {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated when the Services have been determined by IBM to materially implement {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} control requirements. Similarly, IBM designates ecosystem partners as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated when the partners conform to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services® reference architectures and guidance and have been determined by IBM to materially implement the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} control requirements. Clients should review associated documentation made available by IBM and ecosystem partners to conduct their due diligence.

Through the shared responsibility model of the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}} and the surrounding standardized processes, financial institutions and ecosystem partners get benefits such as:

* Less time that is spent by ecosystem partners demonstrating compliance and more time delivering innovative services.
* Reduction in the time and effort by financial institutions to ensure the compliance of third-party vendors, and more time spent delivering new, innovative services to their customers.
* Streamlined procurement, contracting, and onboarding within the ecosystem that leads to reduced time to market for all parties.

In addition, ecosystem partners (even those who are not yet {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated) are encouraged to [onboard to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/docs/sell?topic=sell-selling-clouds).

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}
