# IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validation Process for Partners
{: #fs-validated-partner-process}

IBM designates ecosystem partners' offerings as IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated when the partners' offerings conform to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services® reference architectures and guidance and have been determined by IBM to materially implement the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services control requirements.

The IBM ISV/MSP Acceleration Program works with partners through the process, accelerating time to commercial readiness and reducing the partners' challenge of providing their solution to IBM Cloud customers.

The Financial Services Validation Process for partners follows the following process:

1. Initial meeting
   - Partner and IBM discuss benefits of participating in IBM Cloud for Financial Services ecosystem
   - Verify current NDA in place before discussing confidential information
   - ISV identifies the application(s) and workload(s) they will bring
   - Qualifying questions and discussion about client demand/path to revenue
2. Onboarding kickoff meeting is held
   - Walkthrough of detailed onboarding process steps
   - Service technology stack (Cloud Native: Containers: ROKS, Cloud Native: Virtual Servers, VMWare) decision
   - Service delivery model: BYOL Services, BYOL Software, Hosted Managed Service, Joint Delivery, SaaS: Multi-tenant, SaaS: Single-tenant) decision
   - ISV begins technical and architecture assessments ensuring they can conform to architecture requirements
4. ISV onboards their service to the IBM ecosystem
   - ISV becomes a member of Partner Plus (IBM Ecosystem partnership program)
   - Implementation of IBM Cloud for Financial Services controls framework for the ISV solution
   - ISV signs an ESA (Embedded Solution Agreement) if IBM Cloud is embedded in their solution
   - Optionally work to list the ISV solution in the IBM Cloud Catalog (with ESA)
5. ISV completes Security Assessments and demonstrates ability to meet applicable IBM Cloud for Financial Services controls and provides evidence
   - Based on controls specific to Software and/or SaaS model
   - Security & Compliance Center configured
6. IBM Validation Team completes testing and review to designate ISV offering “Financial Services Validated”
   - ISV enabled to share CIOD report with customers as applicable

Notes:
   - Some customers may be willing to conduct POC on IBM Cloud with the partner offering before FS Validation is complete
   - Periodic reassessment required to maintain designation
