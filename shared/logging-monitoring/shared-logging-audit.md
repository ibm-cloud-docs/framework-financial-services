# Audit logging of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} events
{: #shared-logging-audit}

When you work in a cloud environment, such as the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must plan for auditing and monitoring of workloads and data. This should be guided by your internal policies together with industry and location-based compliance requirements. It’s critical to capture audit events generated by the cloud services and hosted workloads running on the cloud platform. With effective audit logging you can investigate abnormal activity and demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. By actively monitoring audit events, you can identify and investigate potential security problems and take corrective action.

A core part of the auditing and logging capabilities for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is the forwarding of audit records for each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service through [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/atracker). Through this service, there is the forwarding of all audit events that record the activity of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} APIs and all consumers of the API, such as, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and console.

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} receives all audit events from cloud services and they're forwarded to one of three different targets:

* {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search

The architecture for IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing [supports high availability](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-ha_dr) and [is hosted in selected regions](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-regions).

How you process the audit event logs will depend on the data categorization of the audit events and risk appetite set by your organization. Audit event logs are designed to contain information that many organizations would not categorize as extremely sensitive. However, they do contain IP addresses and the names of cloud resources that some organizations might deem as sensitive requiring enhanced assurance through the use of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated services.

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} (Enterprise Plan) are all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated.
It's recommended that you use these services for capturing and forwarding {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform audit events with a high data categorization.

If you organization deems the audit events aren't the highest data classification, they may decide the additional assurance of a service that's {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated isn't required. In this case, it may be that {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search offering is an option for your organization.

Understand the handling requirements for audit logs in your organization to decide on the appropriate solution.

## Activity Tracker Event Routing
{: #activity-tracker-event-routing-setup}

Use [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/atracker) to [forward auditable events from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-cloud_services_atracker) to either {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} (Enterprise Plan).

Only {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} using the Enterprise Plan is {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated. For more information on {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} compliance, see [Understanding compliance for Event Streams](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-compliance).
{: tip}

You will find further information on Activity Tracker Event Routing in the cloud documentation:

* A description of [{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/atracker)
* Configuring for [Cloud Object Storage target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started-target-cos)
* Configuring for [{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started-target-event-streams)
* The [Cloud services generating audit events](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-cloud_services_atracker)

You must:

* Ensure encryption of object storage with KYOK or BYOK using keys managed either by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} or {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, based on the audit events data categorization and risk appetite of your organization. For information on encrypting Cloud Object Storage, see [Server-Side Encryption with Hyper Protect Crypto Services](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-hpcs).
* Configure storage capacity for audit log storage to support retention requirements with retention of at least 90 days of online records and one years’ worth of records offline to support archival. For managing retention of data, see [Deleting stale data with expiration rules](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-expiry).
* Monitor to ensure that any limits, such as quota, aren't reached for Object Storage and are increased if necessary. For setting quotas on storage, see [Setting a quota on a bucket](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-quota).
* Ensure audit events are available from collection from Cloud Object Storage for log analysis or forwarded from Event Streams to your security information and event management (SIEM) solution for threat monitoring.

Online retention refers to security audit logs that are available for analysis within one hour or less, and offline retention refers to security audit logs that are available for analysis within two business days or less.

## {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search
{: #activity-tracker-hosted-event-search-setup}

Use [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} hosted event search](/docs/activity-tracker) to capture a record of your IBM Cloud activities and monitor the activity of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions, and comply with regulatory audit requirements. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard and stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.

As the service doesn't have Financial Services Validation, we don’t recommend it for sensitive or high category data than you may decide to use this capability if the data isn't at your highest level of categorization for your organization, as it offers additional functionality including the ability to display, search and alert on audit events without the need to hosting a log management solution. It may also be a suitable solution for application testing or a proof of concept as the events can be redirected using {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} when the application uses more sensitive data.

You will find further information on {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search in the cloud documentation:

* A description of [Activity Tracker hosted event search](/docs/activity-tracker)
* Provisioning [an instance of Activity Tracker](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision)
* The Cloud services [generating audit events](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cloud_services)

You must:

* Ensure the storage is encrypted with KYOK or BYOK using keys managed either by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} or {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, based on the audit events data categorization and risk appetite of your organization. For Activity Tracker hosted event search, see [Encrypt data with your own key](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-adoption#adoption_archive_1) for more information.
* Configure storage capacity for audit log storage to support retention requirements with retention of at least 90 days of online records and one years’ worth of records offline to support archival. For managing retention of data, see [Deleting stale data with expiration rules](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-expiry).
* Monitor to ensure that any limits, such as quota, aren't reached for Object Storage and are increased if necessary. For setting quotas on storage, see [Setting a quota on a bucket](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-quota). For managing large numbers of unexpected audit events, see [Managing volume spike protection and costs](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-control_usage_index_rate&interface=ui).
* Ensure audit events are [configured to forward to Event Streams](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-streaming-configure) and onto to your security information and event management (SIEM) solution for threat monitoring.
