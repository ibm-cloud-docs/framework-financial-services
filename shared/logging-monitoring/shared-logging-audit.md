# Audit logging of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} events
{: #shared-logging-audit}


When you work in a cloud environment, such as the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must plan the cloud strategy for auditing and monitoring workloads and data in accordance with your internal policies and with industry and country-based compliance requirements. It is critical to capture audit events generated by the components of your service. With proper audit logs you can investigate abnormal activity and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. By actively monitoring these events, you can check into potential security problems and take corrective action shortly after they've occurred.
{: shortdesc}

[{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started-routing&interface=cli) is used to collect [auditable events from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cloud_services) that are generated for variety of [event types](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event_types). These events allow you to monitor the activity of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account so that you can investigate abnormal activity and critical actions.

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} provides for either event routing or hosted event search. However, only the event routing features of {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} have been Financial Services Validated. In regions where it's available, you must configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} to send events to {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. All {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} buckets must be encrypted with KYOK using keys managed by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. See [Encryption at rest](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest) for more information.

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} event routing is only available in some regions (see [Locations for {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-regions#regions-atracker) for more details). For regions where it's not available, you must use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} hosted event search until {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is available. After event routing becomes available in those regions, you must switch to use event routing. See [Use only services that are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-financial-services-validated-services) for more information and possible exceptions.

You must also:

* Configure storage capacity for audit log storage to support retention requirements. Your configuration should allow for retention of 90 days of online records and one (1) yearsâ€™ worth of records offline to support archival Online retention refers to security audit logs that are available for analysis within one (1) hour or less, and offline retention refers to security audit logs that are available for analysis within two (2) business days or less. This provides you the ability to support after-the-fact investigations when potential incidents are detected.
* Monitor to ensure that more audit storage is allocated if needed.
* Ensure that audit events are collected from your Cloud Object Storage instance and added to your [security information and event management (SIEM)](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-logging-audit-provider)

## Setup {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}
{: #activity-tracking-setup}

* Set up {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} by following the instructions in [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} event routing](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started-routing&interface=cli).

When you set up your Cloud Object Storage bucket, you should be sure to use {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to encrypt the bucket with KYOK. See [Create a new bucket with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} managed encryption keys (SSE-KP)](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api-bucket-operations#compatibility-api-key-protect) for more details.
