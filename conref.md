## Service descriptions

### Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud



{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled service which runs in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.
{: #satellite-enabled-openshift}

### Container Registry



### Virtual Private Endpoint



VPE is an evolution of the private connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service, or service instance, basis (depending on the service operation model). The endpoint gateway is a virtualized function that scales horizontally, is redundant and highly available, and spans all availability zones of your VPC. Endpoint gateways enable communications from virtual server instances within your VPC and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service on the private backbone. VPE for VPC gives you the experience of controlling all the private addressing within your cloud.

### Cloud Object Storage

<!-- TODO: Moved this to phrases.json so I could use in table cells.
[{{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.
{: #service-description-cloud-object-storage-1}
-->

Users of {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.
{: #service-description-cloud-object-storage-2}

All {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} buckets must be encrypted with KYOK by using keys that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-encryption-at-rest). In addition, a geographically separate region should be used as an [alternative storage site](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-bcdr#your-workloads-requirements-alternate-storage-site). This means you should use [cross region resiliency](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints-geo) for all of your {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} buckets.

### Hyper Protect Crypto Services

<!-- TODO: Moved this to phrases.json so I could use in table cells.
[{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. This service allows you to take the ownership of the cloud HSM to fully manage your encryption keys and to perform cryptographic operations using Keep Your Own Key (KYOK). {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is also the only service in the cloud industry that is built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4-certified hardware.
{: #service-description-hpcs}
-->

### App ID

<!-- TODO: Moved this to phrases.json so I could use in table cells.
[{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}](/docs/appid?topic=appid-about) helps developers to easily add authentication to their web and mobile apps with few lines of code, and secure their cloud-native applications and services on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: #service-description-app-id}
-->

### Activity Tracker Event Routing

[{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/atracker) is used to collect auditable platform events that are generated by services in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. These events allow you to monitor the activity of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account so that you can investigate abnormal activity and critical actions.
{: #service-description-activity-tracker-event-routing-1}

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} provides for either event routing or [hosted event search](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started). However, only the event routing features of {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} are Financial Services Validated. In regions where it's available, you must configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} to send events to {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, where they must be encrypted with KYOK.
{: #service-description-activity-tracker-event-routing-2}

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is only available in some regions (see [Locations for {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} event routing](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-regions) for more details). For regions where it's not available, you must use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} hosted event search until {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is available. When event routing becomes available in those regions, you must switch to use event routing. For more information and possible exceptions, see [Use only services that are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-financial-services-validated-services).

### Event Streams

<!-- TODO: Moved these to phrases.json so I could use in table cells.
[{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-about) is a high-throughput message bus built with Apache Kafka. It is optimized for event ingestion into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and event stream distribution between your services and applications.
{: #service-description-event-streams-1}
-->

You can use {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} to complete the following tasks:
{: #service-description-event-streams-2}

- Offload work to back-end worker applications.
- Connect event streams to streaming analytics to realize powerful insights.
- Publish event data to multiple applications to react in real time.
{: #service-description-event-streams-3-unordered-list}

### Security and Compliance Center

<!-- TODO: Moved this to phrases.json so I could use in table cells.
With [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started) you can embed security checks into your every day workflows to help monitor for security and compliance. By monitoring for risks, you can identify security vulnerabilities and quickly work to mitigate the impact and fix the issue. By using {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} along with [external integrations](/security-compliance/integrations) (such as, OpenShift Compliance Operator (OSCO), Tanium, NeuVector, and so on), you can build a robust approach for monitoring for security and compliance issues.

## Bastion host requirements

- Full session recording of actions executed via the bastion to perform session audits. This includes SSH, and Kubernetes exec (`kubectl exec -it`) sessions.
    - Linux-based session recordings are captured as a raw dump of stdout and stderr streams, including TAB characters (bash escape sequences).
    - Session recordings should be placed in to a storage service maintained within your environment for archiving. The storage should be configured as “immutable object storage.” Retention policies are should be applied to the storage, so that data is stored in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many), non-erasable and non-rewritable manner. The policy is set and enforced for a 12-month (minimum) retention period.
- Authenticating users with MFA using a physical hardware-based security key that generates a six-digit numerical code. A smart card or hardware token designed and operated to FIPS 140-2 level 2 or above or equivalent (e.g., ANSI X9.24, ISO 13491-1:2007) is recommended.
- Locking user accounts after three (3) consecutive failed logon attempts within 15 minutes.
- Locking user accounts for 30 minutes when there have been more than three unsuccessful logon attempts. After the lockout period ends, the user will be able to reset their password. Internal privileged accounts must remain locked until released by an administrator.
- Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- Providing a system use notification banner from either the bastion or the target system. The warning banner is displayed before the system grants access to the user and the usage conditions must be approved before proceeding. The banner will provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable customer policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The warning banner will state that:
    - Users are accessing a financial services information system.
    - Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit.
    - Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties.
    - Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.
