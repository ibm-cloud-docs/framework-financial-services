# Reference architecture overview
{: #reference-architecture-overview}

The {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} provides three reference architectures that can be used as a basis for meeting the security and regulatory requirements that are defined in the framework. Learn about these reference architectures in the following table.

| Reference architecture   | Description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| [{{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC)](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about)   | Built by using [{{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc#about-vpc), which enables an enterprise to establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure. The architecture has options for using one or both of [{{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}}](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-detailed-vsi) and [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong}}](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-detailed-openshift)  |
| [{{site.data.keyword.satellitelong}}](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about)   | Built by using [{{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}}](/docs/satellite), so you can create a hybrid environment that brings the scalability and on-demand flexibility of public cloud services to the applications and data that run in your secure private cloud (such as on-premises). |
| [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for VMware® Regulated Workloads](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vmware-overview)  | Built by using [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware Regulated Workloads](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vrw-archi-overview), which is an extension of the VMware vCenter Server® offering. Its design extends and enhances the basic vCenter Server architecture to deliver a secure, high-performance platform. |
