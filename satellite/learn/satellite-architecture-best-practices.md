{: #satellite-architecture-best-practices}

## Relation to {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_full}} best practices
{: #satellite-architecture-best-practices}



The following table provides a summary of how the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture can be used by the workload provider and the on-premises IaaS / Data Center provider to implement the [best practices and requirements](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices) of the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}}. It is intended as a supplemental checklist to the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture shared responsibility model](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-shared-responsibilities) and the [shared responsibilities](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities) for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} in general.



| Best practice | Workload provider | On-premises IaaS / Data Center provider |
|----------|--------|--------|
| [Use an approved reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-reference-architecture) | - Use the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about) described here. | - Use the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about) described here. |
| [Use only services that are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for Financial Services Validated](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-financial-services-validated-services) | - Use the [Financial Services Validated services](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about#components-ibm-cloud-services) that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture. | - No infrastructure (beyond what is provided for your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location) is needed to use Financial Services Validated services that are part of the reference architecture. |
| [Ensure that all deployed software meets all control requirements](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-self-installed-software) | - Consider the software that you plan to install into your workload clusters in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location. Ensure that software is developed, deployed, configured, and managed in a way that is consistent with the control requirements. | - Consider the pieces of software that you plan to install into any part of your underlying infrastructure in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location or your supporting on-premises environment outside of {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}. Ensure that software is developed, deployed, configured, and managed in a way that is consistent with the control requirements. |

| [Ensure that all operator actions are run through a bastion host](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-bastion-host) | - Ensure all interactive operator actions to manage the application in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations can be run through a bastion host only in your dedicated edge or management plane. \n - Enable recording of bastion sessions for auditing. | - Ensure all interactive operator actions to manage your on-premises infrastructure can be run through a bastion host only. \n - Enable recording of bastion sessions for auditing. |
| [Capture audit events and forward to a SIEM](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices#best-practices-audit-logs) | - For {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, capture audit events by using {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} encrypted using KYOK. In addition, ensure that those events are sent to a security information and event management (SIEM). See [Audit logging of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} audit events](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-logging-audit) for more details. \n - For application code that runs in your {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, ensure that auditable events are captured and forwarded to a SIEM.
