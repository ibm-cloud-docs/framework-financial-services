Two uses cases from real financial institutions are presented in the following sections.

## US regional bank 
{: #satellite-architecture-use-cases-1}

During a time-sensitive merger, a US regional bank needed to integrate two entitiesâ€™ IT operations securely and bring consistency across container platforms in on-premises branch locations without adding overhead. {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} enabled the customer to establish a location that used its existing data center infrastructure and create multiple {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} clusters so that teams could build and host containerized workloads in a consistent way and pay only for what they consumed. This scenario is an example of using {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} for platform modernization.

The following diagram shows a high-level overview of the architecture that is used by this financial institution.

Key features of their approach include:
 
- Using VMWare or other virtualization infrastructure to provide the hosts in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.
- Leveraging a proxy that they manage for traffic to and from the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.
- Running {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} for their workloads and exploring other {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled services in later phases when they become Financial Services Validated.
- Hosting on-premises databases on virtual machines outside the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location within the enterprise.
- Placing management tools in virtual servers within their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
- Using the following services on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}:
    - IAM for identity and access management
    - {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} to collect {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} audit events
    - {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} for backup and archiving data

## Multinational bank
{: #satellite-architecture-use-cases-2}

A multinational bank wanted to ensure they were following local requirements for data residency by keeping data in country when they were accessing public cloud services. The {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture was a perfect fit for them.

The following diagram shows a high-level overview of the architecture that is used by this second institution.

![High-level modification of {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture for the second institution](../images/satellite-use-cases/satellite_use_case_2_beta2_04_06.svg){: caption="High-level modification of {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture for the second institution" caption-side="bottom"}

Highlights of their architecture include the following:

- Using on-premises virtual infrastructure for the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location
- Using a proxy that they manage for traffic to and from the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location
- Running {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} for their workloads
- Integrating with various on-premises solutions (outside of the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location) for logging, monitoring, image registry, and DevOps
- Using the following services on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}:
    - IAM for identity and access management, federated with an external identity provider (Active Directory Federation Services)
    - {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} for {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} control plane backups
    - {{site.data.keyword.redhat_notm}} NTP to sync the time on all nodes
