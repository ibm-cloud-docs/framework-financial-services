# {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture shared responsibility model
{: #satellite-architecture-shared-responsibilities}

In {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the responsibilities for deploying, operating, and securing products are shared between {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} and our customers. This [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} shared responsibility model](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities) is one of the most important things to understand when interpreting the control requirements of the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}}. Here we dive deeper into this shared responsibility model for the [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about).
{: shortdesc}

## Shared responsibilities for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} products
{: #satellite-architecture-shared-responsibilities-roles}

All services that run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} as part of the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} reference architecture are considered [managed products](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities#managed-responsibilities) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} shared responsibility model. Each of these products has their own [service-specific shared responsibilities](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-responsibilities). 

Due to the hybrid nature of {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}, there is a unique set of [{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-specific shared responsibilities](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities) for components that run in the on-premises {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.

For all products, these responsibilities cut across the following five task areas, which intersect with the {{site.data.keyword.framework-fs_notm}}'s [best practices and requirements](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-best-practices):

| Types of tasks | Description |
| - | - |
| [Incident and operations management](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities#incident-and-ops) | Includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery.  |
| [Change management](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities#change-management) | Includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion. |
| [Identity and access management](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities#iam-responsibilities) | Includes tasks such as authentication, authorization, access control policies, and approving, granting, and revoking access. |
| [Security and regulation compliance](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities#security-compliance) | Includes tasks such as security controls implementation and compliance certification. |
| [Disaster Recovery](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-responsibilities#disaster-recovery) | Includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provision disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events. |

## Additional roles for shared responsibility matrix
{: #satellite-architecture-shared-responsibilities-roles}

The two-party view of responsibility doesn't adequately account for the broader set of roles (often represented by teams or even different companies) that need to collaborate to ensure that the overall solution provides a secure platform for workloads and data. In the following diagram and table, a broader set of roles is defined.

| Role | Description |
| - | - |
| Workload consumer | Line-of-business organization that uses the workload or represents the internal or external users of the workload.  |
| Workload provider | Client IT development and operations team responsible for developing, deploying, and managing the workload and user responsibility for the PaaS layer (for example, by providing updated operating system images or requesting worker node upgrades). |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} on-premises PaaS provider | {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development and operations teams responsible for the Satellite components deployed on-premises. Many supporting services, processes, and operations run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. |
| On-premises IaaS / data center provider | Client IT operations and facilities teams responsible for the data center, networking, hardware, and virtualization that supports the on-premises PaaS and workload. |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IaaS / data center provider | {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development and operations teams responsible for the direct {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} management capabilities and supporting services that run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. |

## Overview of shared responsibilities
{: #overview-by-resource}


Review the following table of who is responsible for particular cloud resources when using {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}. In the table, "Shared" means that there is a shared responsibility between the workload provider and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} on-premises PaaS provider.
