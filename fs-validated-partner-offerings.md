# IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated Partner Offerings
{: #fs-validated-partner-offerings}

IBM designates ecosystem partners' offerings as IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated when the partners' offerings conform to the IBM Cloud for Financial ServicesÂ® reference architectures and guidance and have been determined by IBM to materially implement the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services control requirements. Clients should review associated documentation made available by IBM and ecosystem partners to conduct their due diligence.

Through the shared responsibility model of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services and the surrounding standardized
processes, financial institutions and ecosystem partners get benefits such as:

 - Less time that is spent by ecosystem partners demonstrating compliance and more time delivering innovative services.
 - Reduction in the time and effort by financial institutions to ensure the compliance of third-party vendors, and more time spent delivering new, innovative services to their customers.
 - Streamlined procurement, contracting, and onboarding within the ecosystem that leads to reduced time to market for all parties.

Ecosystem partners (even those who are not yet IBM Cloud for Financial Services Validated) are encouraged to onboard to the IBM Cloud catalog.

## List of FS Validated ISV Offerings

> Note this list only includes partners who have completed the FS validation process with IBM and have been evaluated by IBM to have correctly implemented the Framework. Partners going through the process now are not listed.  There are also many more ISVs and Partners not listed here that make up the broader ecosystem of IBM Cloud for Financial Services.
